1. Introduction
Mountain Care is a Next.js-based, single-tenant HR Management platform intended to handle core HR functionalities—employee management, attendance tracking, leave management, onboarding/offboarding automation, compliance (including HIPAA considerations), document management, and basic reporting. The target organization has approximately 250 employees and does not experience significant usage spikes.

2. Architectural Approach
Monolithic, Modular Organization

Front-end and back-end (API routes) are part of the same Next.js codebase.

Features are separated into modules (employee, attendance, leave, compliance, etc.) for clarity and maintainability.

Why a Modular Monolith?

Simplicity: Easier for a small-to-medium HR team or a single-tenant setup.

Unified Deployment: Simple to deploy on Vercel (or a single Docker instance) without complex orchestrations.

Future Flexibility: Should demands grow, modules can be broken out into separate services.

3. Technology Stack
Frameworks & Libraries

Next.js (React 18+) for front-end + server-side rendering.

NextAuth.js for authentication.

TypeORM as the ORM for structured database access.

PostgreSQL for the primary relational database.

Node.js (16+ recommended).

Key Rationale

TypeORM & PostgreSQL: Well-suited for relational data and transactions. TypeORM simplifies migrations, schema updates, and eliminates most raw SQL complexities.

Next.js: Provides both client and server logic in one place, plus easy serverless deployment.

Single-Tenancy: Data modeling is simpler than multi-tenant (no separate tenant tables or schemas needed).

4. Front-End & Back-End Communication
Next.js API Routes

Each domain has a dedicated route (e.g., /api/employees, /api/attendance) handling CRUD via TypeORM.

Requests use fetch() or axios from the client to these serverless endpoints.

Data Flow

Front-End → API Route → TypeORM → PostgreSQL

The NextAuth.js session ensures secure authentication tokens or cookies are attached to these requests.

5. Database & Data Storage
Schema Design
While final designs may vary, below are examples of likely tables in PostgreSQL:

Users (for authentication via NextAuth + role management):

id, name, email, passwordHash, role, departmentId, createdAt, updatedAt

Employees:

id, firstName, lastName, departmentId, position, hireDate, etc.

Departments:

id, name, managerId, etc.

Attendance:

id, employeeId, date, timeIn, timeOut, etc.

Leave:

id, employeeId, startDate, endDate, leaveType, status, etc.

Compliance:

id, employeeId, licenseType, expirationDate, status, etc.

Documents:

id, title, filePath, ownerId, version, createdAt, updatedAt

Note: Onboarding/offboarding can have their own tables or be integrated into Employees/Tasks tables, depending on the complexity of automation.

TypeORM Migrations

Maintain schema definitions in TypeORM entities; use typeorm migration:generate to keep DB schema in sync.

Run migrations automatically in staging or production environments.

Backup & Recovery

A backup every 8 hours is recommended. Tools like pg_dump or cloud provider snapshots can achieve this schedule.

Plan for point-in-time recovery if storing transaction logs.

7. Core Features & Modules
Below is a more precise alignment with your clarifications:

Employee Management

~250 employees; no large concurrency or peak usage concerns.

Department-based roles and permissions for managers vs. employees.

CRUD (create, read, update, delete) with separate detail pages for each employee.

Onboarding/Offboarding Automation

Custom tasks assigned (equipment provisioning, document collection, orientation schedule).

Automated notifications or checklists triggered by hiring/termination events.

Optional advanced features: e-signatures, scheduling exit interviews.

Attendance Tracking

Daily logs with time in/out.

Potential to integrate with a scheduling or timeclock system.

Summaries and attendance analytics (e.g., monthly absenteeism rate).

Leave Management

Submission forms, approval flows, calendar visualization.

Department heads or HR managers can approve, reject, or adjust requests.

Integration with attendance to avoid double-booking or conflicting data.

Compliance (HIPAA & Expirations)

Track licenses/certifications, set expiry reminders.

Store potentially sensitive health-related details for employees (subject to HIPAA).

Apply encryption at rest for relevant fields (TypeORM can integrate with Postgres-level encryption or external KMS).

Document Management

Upload documents, store path references in Postgres.

Version control and departmental permission checks.

60-day retention for logs/auditing: keep track of who accessed/modified each document.

Reporting & Analytics

Basic data exports (CSV or PDF) for attendance, leave requests, compliance statuses.

Potentially display high-level HR metrics (turnover rate, time-to-hire, etc.).

Storage of logs for 60 days.

Settings & Configuration

Roles and department-based access (RBAC).

System-level preferences (notifications, backup schedules).

Self-service for employees to update personal info; managers and HR staff have higher privileges.

8. Environment Setup & Configuration
Required Variables (.env or .env.local):

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<some-random-string>

NEXTAUTH_URL=<https://mountain-care.example.com>

Additional secrets for encryption keys if storing HIPAA data in an encrypted column.

Dependencies

Node.js 16+

TypeORM 0.3+

PostgreSQL 12+

Next.js 13+ and React 18+

NextAuth 4+

Automated Deployments

If using Vercel, environment variables can be set in project settings.

If using Docker or AWS, ensure the container or server can access the DB.

9. Security & Access Control
HIPAA Compliance

Encryption at Rest: Use Postgres features like TDE (if available) or disk-level encryption.

Secure Transport: Enforce HTTPS in production, SSL/TLS for DB connections.

Access Logs & Auditing: Keep logs for 60 days to track user actions on sensitive data.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Admins/HR Managers: Full control over employee data, can manage departments.

Department Heads: Limited to employees within their department.

Employees: Access to their own profiles, attendance, and leave data.

Department-based checks integrated with TypeORM queries (e.g., only fetch employees from allowed departments for a manager).

Scheduled Tasks & Notifications

Next.js environment or a Node-based cron for daily HIPAA compliance checks, license expirations, or daily backups.

Authentication

NextAuth.js: Session tokens (JWT or database sessions).

Implement 2FA if required for compliance or sensitive operations.

10. Deployment & Hosting Plans
Vercel

Straightforward Next.js deployment.

Automatic scaling of API routes; only pay for usage.

Connect to a hosted PostgreSQL (e.g., Azure, Heroku, or AWS RDS).

Docker / On-Prem (Alternate)

Build a Docker image with npm run build && npm run start.

Use docker-compose for local dev environment with a Postgres container.

Could be deployed to AWS ECS/EKS or an on-prem Kubernetes cluster.

CI/CD

If on GitHub, use GitHub Actions to run tests, lint, build, and migrations prior to deployment.

Migrations: Run typeorm migration:run on each deploy to keep schema in sync.

11. Maintenance & Scalability
Logging & Monitoring

Use console logs or Winston for structured logs.

Monitoring solutions like Datadog, New Relic, or AWS CloudWatch if scaling beyond Vercel.

Backup Strategy

Database snapshots every 8 hours. Retain incremental logs or transaction logs for point-in-time restore if needed.

For documents, consider a versioned object store (S3, local file system with versioning, or an external solution).

Scheduled Jobs

License expiry notifications and compliance checks can run as serverless cron jobs (e.g., Vercel Cron, GitHub Scheduled Workflows, or an external cron service).

Email reminders or Slack notifications for tasks nearing deadlines.

Scalability

250 employees is manageable with minimal concurrency concerns; the monolithic approach should suffice.

Future growth can be handled by increasing DB resources or introducing caching (Redis). If user count grows significantly, consider microservices or splitting heavier modules.

Ongoing Updates

Maintain a CHANGELOG.md for version tracking.

Keep Node.js, Next.js, and TypeORM updated for security patches.

Regularly review logs and audits to ensure HIPAA and internal compliance.

12. Troubleshooting & Edge Cases
Concurrency & Transactions

Automated portions of onboarding/offboarding may require careful transaction handling to avoid partial data updates.

TypeORM’s transactional decorators or the QueryRunner can ensure atomic operations.

HIPAA & Data Privacy

Must restrict access to any medical data to authorized personnel only.

Sensitive columns (e.g., health details) should be encrypted or stored in a separate table if needed.

Automatic Offboarding

Removing or deactivating employees from the system must ensure no orphan records remain.

Carefully revoke system access, handle final pay/leave, and archive relevant data.

Department-based Roles

Ensure queries filter by department for managers, or you risk data leaks.

Could implement a middleware to verify user’s department ID before returning data.

13. Additional Considerations
Documentation:

Maintain code-level docs (JSDoc or TypeScript docstrings) for critical modules.

Provide internal Wiki pages for common HR workflows (like how to manage employee benefits, compliance, etc.).

Integrations:

If external payroll or benefits systems become necessary, maintain clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules or microservices in the future.

Naming Conventions:

Use PascalCase for React components and TypeORM entities, camelCase for function/variable names, UPPER_CASE for environment variables.
